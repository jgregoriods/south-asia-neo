de Souza, J.G.; Ruiz-PÃ©rez, J.; Lancelotti, C.; Madella, M. (ms) <i>Environmental and geographical effects on the spread of the Neolithic crop package to South Asia.</i>

Different costs of traversing each type of terrain are assigned and the optimal values are searched through a genetic algorithm, with the fitness score given by comparison with the radiocarbon dates.
